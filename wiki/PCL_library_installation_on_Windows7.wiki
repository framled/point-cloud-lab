This page present the long way to getting a working copy of PCL library (and its 3rd party libraries) on a windows PC.

= Introduction
The installation process contains the following steps:
1. Downloading PCL 1.6.0 library pre-built binaries.
2. Installation of QT creator and QT-sdk 5.0.1
3. Installation of Visual-Studio 2010 express (VC++ is sufficient).
4. Getting the basic working program in QT.

==Download PCL 1.6.0==
Use the following link: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pointclouds/files/1.6.0/PCL-1.6.0-AllInOne-msvc2010-win32.exe/download] to download the latest PCL library binaries for 32-bit machine. I strongly suggest using the 32-bit as the 64-bit binaries don't work for the current version (1.6.0) in QT.
Install the binaries in "C:\Program Files\PCL 1.6.0 ...". Take a little tour to the installation path. Notice the 3rd-party folder contains BOOST, Eigen, FLANN, OPENNI, QHULL, VTK libraries.
Not all of those libraries are needed to build a working basic PCL application. For example, if you won't need any visualization ability in your application, the VTK library won't be linked.
